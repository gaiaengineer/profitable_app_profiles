    "## About the project\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a portfolio project where I act as a data analyst for an imaginary company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps for English-speaking markets. The apps are free to download and install on AppStore and Google Play. The main source of revenue for the company consists of in-app ads, which means that the more users download and install the app, the bigger the chance that they'll see and engage with in-app ads.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project is to analyze data to help the developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, I'll need to collect and analyze data about mobile apps available on Google Play and the App Store. \n",
    "\n",
    "As of September 2018, there were approximately 2 million iOS apps available on the App Store, and 2.1 million Android apps on Google Play. \n",
    "\n",
    "Collecting data for over 4 million apps requires a significant amount of time and money, so I'll try to analyze a sample of the data instead. To avoid spending resources on collecting new data by myself, I'll first try to see if I can find any relevant existing data at no cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, there is [a learning dataset of AppStore apps available on Kaggle](tab:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps). There is also a [public dataset of Google Play apps](tab:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps). \n",

We'll need this, because dictionaries don't have order, and it will be very difficult to analyze the frequency tables without any order present. To do that,  we'll need to make use of the built-in ```sorted()``` function. This function takes in an iterable data type (like a list, dictionary, tuple, etc.), and returns a list of the elements of that iterable sorted in ascending or descending order (the reverse parameter controls whether the order is ascending or descending). It does not work well with dictionaries because it only considers and returns the dictionary keys.

    "### Preliminary Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we can conclude that App Store is dominated by apps designed for entertainment, while Google Play shows a more balanced landscape of both practical and entertainment apps. However, this data is mostly **helpful in learning how app publishers behave**. Let's additionally investigate the user dynamics and see **which kinds of apps have the biggest number of users**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### App Store: Most Popular Apps by Genre \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with iOS apps. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to find out what genres are the most popular (have the most users) is to calculate the average number of installs for each app genre. For the Google Play data set, we can find this information in the ```Installs``` column, but this information is missing for the App Store data set. As a workaround, we'll take the total number of user ratings as a proxy, which we can find in the ```rating_count_tot``` app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with calculating the average number of user ratings per app genre on the App Store. To do that, we'll need to do the following:\n",
    "* Isolate the apps of each genre\n",
    "* Add up the user ratings for the apps of that genre\n",
    "* Divide the sum by the number of apps belonging to that genre (not by the total number of apps)\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we'll need to use *nested loop*:  \n",
    "* Generate a frequency table for the ```prime_genre``` column to get the unique app genres (below, we'll need to loop over the unique genres). We'll use the ```freq_table()``` function we wrote before.\n",
    "* Loop over the unique genres of the App Store dataset. For each iteration:\n",
    "  * Initiate a variable named ```total``` with a value of ```0```. This variable will store the sum of user ratings (the number of ratings, not the actual ratings) specific to each genre.\n",
    "  * Initiate a variable named ```len_genre``` with a value of ```0```. This variable will store the number of apps specific to each genre.\n",
    "   * Loop over the App Store dataset, and for each iteration, do the following:\n",
    "        * Save the app genre to a variable named ```genre_app```.\n",
    "        * If ```genre_app``` is the same as ```genre``` (the iteration variable of the main loop), then do the following:\n",
    "            * Save the number of user ratings of the app as a float.\n",
    "            * Add up the number of user ratings to the total variable.\n",
    "            * Increment the ```len_genre``` variable by 1.\n",
    "    * Compute the average number of user ratings by dividing ```total``` by ```len_genre```. \n",
    "    * Print the app genre and the average number of user ratings. "

    "If we observe the level of medium popularity, we'll find pretty much the same situation as in App Store: building an app around a popular book OR adding supplementary functionality to a reader app, turning it into a productivity & lifestyle app seems to be a nice idea.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a portfolio project where I acted as a data analyst for an imaginary company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps for English-speaking markets. The apps are free to download and install on AppStore and Google Play. The main source of revenue for the company consists of in-app ads, which means that the more users download and install the app, the bigger the chance that they'll see and engage with in-app ads. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal was to recommend an app profile that can be profitable for both markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "I performed exploratory data analysis on two data sets: [a learning dataset of AppStore apps available on Kaggle](tab:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) and a [public dataset of Google Play apps](tab:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps). \n",
    "\n",
    "After performing data cleaning (which includes removing or correcting wrong data, removing duplicate data, and modifying the data to fit the purpose of our analysis), I observed the data sets to learn which app genres are mostly present on both stores and whether they are popular with the users. \n",
    "\n",
    "I ended up with recommending a book app enhanced with additional functionalities, which falls into the category of popular apps and allows the company to effectively compete in two genres: books/reference and productivity/lifestyle. Possible product development includes: \n",
    "* gamification features, such as a \"reading strike\" or achievements that promote daily reading\n",
    "* in-app dictionaries to attract users who otherwise download a separate dictionary app\n",
    "* a read-aloud AI feature to accomodate the needs of people with kids and compete on the extra market (entertainment apps for kids) \n",
    "* alternative monetization models, such as: a way to buy books one by one; lending an e-book for a limited period of time; using internal currency; subscription-based models which are equally interesting for B2B business development opportunities"
