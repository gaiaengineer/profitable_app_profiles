# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

## Project Description

This is a portfolio project where I act as a data analyst for an imaginary company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps for English-speaking markets. The apps are free to download and install on AppStore and Google Play. The main source of revenue for the company consists of in-app ads, which means that the more users download and install the app, the bigger the chance that they'll see and engage with in-app ads. The goal of the project is to analyze data to help the developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users. 

## Data Sets

To do this, I'll need to collect and analyze data about mobile apps available on Google Play and the App Store. As of September 2018, there were approximately 2 million iOS apps available on the App Store, and 2.1 million Android apps on Google Play. Collecting data for over 4 million apps requires a significant amount of time and money, so I'll try to analyze a sample of the data instead. To avoid spending resources on collecting new data by myself, I'll first try to see if I can find any relevant existing data at no cost. Luckily, there is [a learning dataset of AppStore apps available on Kaggle](tab:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps). There is also a [public dataset of Google Play apps](tab:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps).
